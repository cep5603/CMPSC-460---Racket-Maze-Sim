# CMPSC-460---Racket-Maze-Sim

## How to Use

### The program has three modes you may use to navigate through the maze:

- Manual (default)
- Random walk
- BFS

You may switch between any of the three modes at any time. To do so, just press the corresponding key:

- `m` to return to manual
- `r` to switch to automatic random walk
- `s` to switch to automatic BFS

In the automatic mode, the program runs itself, at a default rate of 10 ticks per second.
